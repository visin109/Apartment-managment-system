Apartment Managment System:


This is a fullstack web application.So the problem statement here is to manage ,clarify and  resolve all people's complaints in the apartment.
Apartment managment system is developed in order to maintain,clarify and resolve the issues faced by the people in the 
apartment.Whenever a resident posts a new complaint his details should be added to the database and if needed it must be edited and also deleted when it is resolved.

This application consists of database which is connected using flask module.I used flask for backend and Html,css for front end.The use of some of features include:
Add-Adding lets you add a complaints
Edit-editing to edit existing  user complaints 
Search-search users 
Delete-deletes the entire complaint record about the user after getting resolved.
